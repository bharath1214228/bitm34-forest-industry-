                            <h2>The Company Rule in India (1773-1858) | 05 Oct 2021</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Beginning of Rule:</strong> The British East India Company was established as a trading company in 1600 and transformed into a ruling body in 1765.</li>
<li><strong>Interference in Internal Affairs</strong>: After the <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper1/british-conquest-for-bengal-battles-of-plassey-and-buxar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Battle of Buxar (1764)</strong></a>, the East India <strong>Company got the Diwani</strong> (right to collect revenue) <strong>of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa</strong> and gradually, it started interfering in Indian affairs.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitation of Power:</strong> The period from 1765-72 saw <strong>duality in the system of government</strong> where the Company had the authority but no responsibility and its Indian representatives had all the responsibility but no authority. This resulted in: <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Rampant corruption</strong> among servants of the Company.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive revenue collection</strong> and oppression of peasantry.</li>
<li>The <strong>Company&rsquo;s bankruptcy,</strong> while the servants were flourishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Response of British Government</strong>: To bring some order into the business, the British government decided to regulate the Company with a gradual increase in laws.</li>
</ul>
