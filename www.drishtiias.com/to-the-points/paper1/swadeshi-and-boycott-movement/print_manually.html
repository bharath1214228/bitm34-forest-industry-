                <h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Emergence of Nationalism:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It was only in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century that the concept of a national identity and national consciousness emerged.</li>
<li>The social, economic and political factors had inspired the people to define and achieve their national identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Causes of Growing Nationalism:</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Recognising True British Intents:</strong> The British government was not conceding any of the important demands of the Indians.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The economic miseries of the 1890s further exposed the exploitative character of colonial rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Growth of Confidence:</strong> A feeling started gaining currency that the masses had to be involved in the battle against the colonial government to gain freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing Awareness:</strong> The spread of education led to an increased awareness among the masses about the British policies.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Rise in unemployment and underemployment and resultant poverty further aggravated the discontent among the radical nationalists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>International Influences:</strong> The Indian nationalists were inspired by the nationalist movements worldwide in Ireland, Japan, Egypt, Turkey, Persia and China which demolished the myths of European invincibility.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative Policies of Lord Curzon:</strong> Administrative measures adopted during <a href="../reforms-and-administration-under-lord-curzon.html#:~:text=North%2DWest%20Frontier%20Policy%3A%20Curzon,for%20the%20security%20of%20Chitral." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Lord Curzon's</strong></a> rule such as the Indian Universities Act, the Calcutta Corporation Act and primarily the <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bengal-partition#:~:text=The%20Partition%20of%20India%20in,mass%20migration%20in%20human%20history." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Partition of Bengal</strong></a> led to nationwide protests. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The Swadeshi Movement; one of the most successful movements of the Pre-Gandhian era, was an outcome of the Partition of Bengal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Swadeshi Movement</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Background:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The movement had its roots in the <strong>anti-partition movement</strong> which was started to oppose Lord Curzon&rsquo;s decision of dividing the province of Bengal.</li>
<li>The <strong>Anti-Partition Campaign</strong> was<strong> launched by Moderates</strong> to exert pressure on the government to prevent the unjust partition of Bengal from being implemented.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The petitions were written to the government, public meetings were held and the ideas were spread through newspapers such as<em><strong> Hitabadi, Sanjibani </strong></em>and<strong></strong><em><strong> Bengalee.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The partition led to protest meetings in Bengal under which the pledge to boycott foreign goods was first taken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Swadeshi Movement Proclamation:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In August 1905, at Calcutta Townhall, a massive meeting was held and the <strong>formal proclamation of the Swadeshi Movement was made.</strong></li>
<li>The message was propagated to boycott goods such as <strong>Manchester cloth and Liverpool salt.</strong></li>
<li>After the partition came into force, widespread opposition was shown by the people of Bengal by singing <strong><em>Vande Mataram.</em></strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Rabindranath Tagore also composed <em><strong>Amar Sonar Bangla.</strong></em></li>
<li>People tied <em><strong>Rakhis</strong></em> on each other&rsquo;s hands as a symbol of unity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although the movement was confined majorly to Bengal, it spread to a few different parts of India:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>In Poona and Bombay under<strong> Bal Gangadhar Tilak</strong></li>
<li>In Punjab under <strong>Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh</strong></li>
<li>In Delhi under <strong>Syed Haider Raza</strong></li>
<li>In Madras under<strong> Chidambaram Pillai.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Congres Reaction:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Indian National Congress (INC) in a meeting in 1905 resolved to<strong> condemn the partition of Bengal</strong> and support the anti-partition and Swadeshi Movement.</li>
<li>The radical nationalists wanted the movement to be taken outside Bengal and go beyond just the boycott of foreign goods.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>However, the moderates, dominating the Congress, were unwilling to go that far.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the 1906 <strong>Congress Session held at Calcutta,</strong> the INC under the presidentship of <strong>Dadabhai Naoroji declared self-government or Swaraj as the goal of INC.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the Radical Nationalists:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Extremists (or the <strong>Garam Dal</strong>) gained a dominant influence over the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal after 1905 till 1908; it is also known as the <strong>&ldquo;Era of Passionate Nationalists&rdquo;.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/lala-lajpat-rai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lala Lajpat Rai</a>, <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bal-gangadhar-tilak#:~:text=Key%20Points,also%20known%20as%20Lokmanya%20Tilak." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bal Gangadhar Tilak</a></strong> and Bipin Chandra Pal <strong>(Lal-Bal-Pal)</strong> were important leaders of this Radical group.</li>
<li>The reasons for the same were:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Failure of the Moderate-led Swadeshi movement.</li>
<li>Divisive tactics of the governments of East Bengal and Western Bengal.</li>
<li>Violent measures of the British to suppress the movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition to boycotting the Extremists gave a call for boycotting government schools and colleges, government service, courts, legislative councils, municipalities, government titles, etc.</li>
<li>Tilak gave the slogan <strong>&ldquo;Freedom is my birthright and I shall have it&rdquo;.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Participation of People:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Students:</strong> School and college students were the <strong>most active participants of the movement.</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Student participation was visible in Bengal, Poona (Maharashtra), Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Madras and Salem (Tamil Nadu).</li>
<li>The police adopted a repressive attitude towards the students. The students found guilty were fined, expelled, beaten, arrested and disqualified for government jobs and scholarships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Women:</strong> Traditionally home-centered women too took active part in the movement.</li>
<li><strong>Stand of Muslims:</strong> Some of the muslims participated, however, most of the upper and middle class muslims stayed away.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>They <strong>supported the partition</strong> on the belief that it would provide them a Muslim-majority East Bengal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Swadeshi Movement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Decline in Imports:</strong> It resulted in significant decline in the foreign imports during 1905-1908.</li>
<li><strong>Growth of Extremism:</strong> Movement resulted in growth of extreme nationalism amongst youth which took to violence and wanted to bring an instant end to British dominance.</li>
<li><strong>Morley-Minto Reforms:</strong> It forced British dispensation to offer some concessions to Indians in forms of <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/mains-practice-question/question-193#:~:text=The%20demand%20for%20separate%20electorates,Indians%20by%20Montague%2D%20Chelmsford%20reforms." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Morley-Minto reforms</strong></a> in 1909.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/gopal-krishna-gokhale-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Gopal Krishna Gokhale</strong></a> played an important role in framing these reforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Establishment of Swadeshi Institutions:</strong> Inspired by Rabindranath Tagore&rsquo;s <em><strong>Shantiniketan,</strong></em> the Bengal National College and a number of national schools and colleges in various parts of the country were set up.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In August 1906, the<strong> National Council of Education</strong> was set up to organise the national education system.</li>
<li>A<strong> Bengal Institute of Technology</strong> was set up for technical education.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Swadeshi Industries:</strong> It led to establishments of swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories, tanneries, banks, insurance companies, shops, etc.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It also revived the Indian Cottage Industry.</li>
<li>Indian industries saw regeneration with reawakening of use of indigenous goods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Boycott of Buyers and Sellers:</strong> The foreign goods including clothing, sugar, salt and various other luxury items were not only boycotted, but they were also burned.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Swadeshi movement also led to social boycott of not only buyers but also sellers of foreign goods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Gradual Suppression of the Swadeshi Movement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Government Repression:</strong> By 1908, the Swadeshi Movement was almost over in an open phase due to government&rsquo;s violent repression.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Leaders and Organisation:</strong> The movement failed to create an effective organisation. It was rendered leaderless as most of the leaders were either arrested or deported by the time.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Maintaining the high intensity of such a mass movement was a difficult task in absence of effective leaders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internal Conflicts:</strong> The internal conflicts and difference in ideologies among the leaders did more harm to the movement than good.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Extent:</strong> The movement failed to reach the peasantry and was confined to the upper and middle classes only.</li>
</ul>
<div class="border-bg">
<p><strong>Annulment of Participation of Bengal</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The partition of Bengal was annulled in 1911 by<strong> Lord Hardinge</strong> primarily to curb the revolutionary terrorism.</li>
<li>Bihar and Orissa were taken out of Bengal and Assam was made a separate province.</li>
<li>The annulment was not taken well by the Muslims, consequently, the British <strong>shifted the administrative capital from Calcutta to Delhi,</strong> as the place was associated with Muslim glory.</li>
