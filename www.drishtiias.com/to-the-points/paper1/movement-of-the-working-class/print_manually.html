                            <h2>Movement of the Working Class | 02 Aug 2021</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Rise of Working Class:</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The modern working class <strong>arose in India with the introduction of capitalism in the 19<sup>th</sup> century</strong> under colonial dispensation.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It was a modern working class in the sense of relatively modern organisation of labour and a relatively free market for labour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This development was due to the establishment of modern factories, railways, dockyards and construction activities relating to roads and buildings.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Plantations and railways were the initial enterprises</strong> to herald the era of colonial capitalism in Indian subcontinent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Industrialisation in India:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Port cities <strong>Bombay, Calcutta and Madras</strong> became the<strong> centres of the capitalist economy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cotton mills</strong> in Bombay,<strong> jute mills</strong> in Calcutta, and several factories in Madras were set up in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Similar developments took place in the cities of Ahmedabad, Kanpur, Solapur and Nagpur.</li>
<li>The <strong>first jute mill of India</strong> was set up in <strong>Calcutta in 1854</strong> by a Scottish entrepreneur.</li>
<li>The<strong> ownership of the cotton mills was with the Indian</strong> entrepreneurs, while that of <strong>jute was with the foreigners</strong> for a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workers&rsquo; Movement in Pre-Independence India</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Initial Attempts to Improve Workers&rsquo; Conditions:</strong> Attempts were made in 1870-1880 to better the working conditions of the workers by legislation.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Till the <a href="../swadeshi-and-boycott-movement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Swadeshi surge of 1903-08</strong></a>, there was <strong>no concerted effort</strong> to better the working conditions of the labour.</li>
<li>Again between 1915-1922, there was <strong>resurgence of workers&rsquo; movement</strong> along with the <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bal-gangadhar-tilak" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Home Rule Movement</strong></a> and the <a href="../khilafat-and-non-cooperation-movement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Non-Cooperation Movement.</strong></a></li>
<li>The earlier attempts to improve the economic conditions of the workers were in the nature of <strong>philanthropic efforts which were isolated, sporadic and aimed at specific local grievances.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Workers&rsquo; Movements before the Emergence of Trade Unions: </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Plantation and Mine Workers:</strong> The plantation and mine workers were heavily exploited but their conditions <strong>did not attract much attention initially</strong> as they were away from the notice of early social reformers, journalists and public activists.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Despite this isolation, the plantation workers,<strong> on their own, registered their protests against the exploitation and oppression</strong> by the plantation owners and managers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Workers:</strong> The <strong>cotton and jute industry</strong> workers were <strong>more in the public gaze.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The early social workers and <strong>philanthropists were also involved</strong> with them facilitating better organisational work as well as <strong>better reporting and public support. </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Formation of Organisations:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>In Bengal, <strong>Sasipada Banerjee</strong> founded the<strong> &lsquo;Working Men&rsquo;s Club&rsquo;</strong> in 1870 and started publishing a monthly journal in Bengali entitled<em><strong> &lsquo;Bharat Shramjibi&rsquo;</strong> </em>in 1874.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper4/raja-ram-mohan-roy#:~:text=Raja%20Ram%20Mohan%20Roy%20founded,and%20reading%20of%20the%20scriptures." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Brahmo Samaj</strong> </a>formed the<strong> &lsquo;Working Men&rsquo;s Mission&rsquo;</strong> in Bengal in 1878 to impart moral education among the workers. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It also established the <strong>&lsquo;Working Men&rsquo;s Institution&rsquo;</strong> in 1905.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 1890 in Maharashtra, <strong>N.M. Lokhandey</strong> established the <strong>&lsquo;Bombay Millhands&rsquo;</strong> Association&rsquo;, and in 1898, he started publishing a journal entitled <em><strong>&lsquo;Dinbandhu&rsquo;</strong></em> in Marathi. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The <strong>Bombay Millhands Defence Association</strong> formed by <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bal-gangadhar-tilak" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak</strong></a> in 1908.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, these bodies were primarily <strong>interested in welfare activities</strong> and did <strong>not have much organisational base</strong> among the workers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emergence and Growth of Trade Unions:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Cause of Emergence:</strong> The trade unions emerged in India after <a href="../world-war-i-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>World War I</strong></a>. The main factors that led to the emergence of trade unions include:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Rising prices of essential commodities.</li>
<li>Decline in the real wages of workers.</li>
<li>Increase in the demand for the industrial products resulting in the expansion of Indian industries.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/mahatma-gandhi-jayanti" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Gandhi's</strong></a> call for the <a href="../khilafat-and-non-cooperation-movement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Non-Cooperation Movement</strong></a>.</li>
<li>The Russian Revolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Formation of Trade Unions:</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The <strong>Madras Labour Union,</strong> formed in April 1918, is generally<strong> considered to be the first trade union in India. </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>B.P. Wadia,</strong> a nationalist leader and an associate of <strong>Annie Besant,</strong> was instrumental for its organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The<strong> Textile Labour Association,</strong> also known as <em><strong>Majur Mahajan Sangh,</strong></em> was established in Ahmedabad in 1920. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The union was formed following the agitation of mill workers of Ahmedabad demanding for a bonus to compensate for the rise in prices.</li>
<li>This union worked along Gandhian lines and became very strong over the years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC):</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>A New Edge to the Workers&rsquo; Movement:</strong> The most important development in the workers&rsquo; movement was the formation of<strong> All-India Trade Union Congress</strong> under the <strong>leadership of Bal Gangadhar Tilak</strong> and <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/lala-lajpat-rai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Lala Lajpat Rai.</strong></a><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Since then the working class movement became strong and by 1930 onwards, an ideological tone was added to the movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cause of Formation:</strong> Many people connected with labour realised that there was a <strong>need for a central organisation of labour</strong> to coordinate the works of the trade unions all over India.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The<strong> formation of the <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-international-institution/international-labour-organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Labour Organisation (ILO)</a></strong> in 1919 acted as a catalyst for it.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The members selected from AITUC represented the Indian Labour at the ILO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leaders Involved: Bal Gangadhar Tilak, N.M.Joshi, B.P.Wadia, Diwan Chamanlall, Lala Lajpat Rai and Joseph Baptista</strong> were the <strong>main leaders behind the formation</strong> of AITUC.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Lala Lajpat Rai <strong>became the first president</strong> of the AITUC and Joseph Baptista its <strong>vice president.</strong></li>
<li>Lajpat Rai was the <strong>first to link capitalism with imperialism:</strong> &ldquo;imperialism and militarism are the twin children of capitalism&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ideology of AITUC:</strong> In the beginning, the AITUC was influenced by social democratic ideas of the British Labour Party.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Gandhian philosophy of non-violence, trusteeship and class-collaboration had great influence on AITUC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Trade Union Act, 1926:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The act recognised trade unions as legal associations.</li>
<li>It laid down conditions for registration and regulation of trade union activities.</li>
<li>It secured civil and criminal immunity for trade unions from prosecution for legitimate activities, but also put some restrictions on their political activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Role of Communists:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Emergence of Communists and CPI:</strong> The most important phenomenon in the field of labour movement in India was the emergence of the communists.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The communist ideology, deriving from the theories of <strong>Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin,</strong> assigns the working class the central place.</li>
<li>The <strong>Communist Party of India (CPI),</strong> formed in Soviet Union in 1920, soon after its formation, <strong>became active in the labour movements.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Role in the Movements:</strong> The communists organised the workers in cotton mills of Bombay and jute mills of Calcutta, besides many other industries and led militant struggles.</li>
<li><strong>Role in Splitting the AITUC:</strong> By 1928-29, the communists gained a marginal majority in the AITUC.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Splitting the Moderates:</strong> In the<strong> tenth session of the AITUC held in Nagpur,</strong> the communists<strong> called for the dissociation from the ILO</strong> and<strong> association with the League against Imperialism.</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The moderate and reformist group were against the idea and consequently left the AITUC and formed the <strong>Indian Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU).</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Splitting the Nationalists:</strong> Another split occurred in 1931 due to divergence between the nationalist and communist opinions.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The <strong>communists severely criticised Gandhi</strong> and <strong>condemned the <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/dr-b-r-ambedkar-s-63rd-mahaparinirvan-diwas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Round Table Conference</a> of 1931</strong> in which the <a href="../important-indian-national-congress-sessions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Indian National Congress</strong></a> was participating.</li>
<li>Unable to secure a majority for this condemnation, the <strong>communists split from the nationalists</strong> and formed the <strong>Red Trade Union Congress (RTUC).</strong></li>
<li>By 1931, there were three national federations of trade unions &ndash; the AITUC, the IFTU and the RTUC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reunion of Trade Unions:</strong> It was felt by many trade union leaders that the division in their ranks was creating problems for their political and economic struggles.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>As a result, the <strong>Railway Unions and some unaffiliated unions united with the IFTU</strong> to form the <strong>National Federation of Trade Unions (NFTU)</strong> in 1933.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Consequently, the<strong> RTUC, and the AITUC also united</strong> in 1935 and the name AITUC was retained for the unified organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workers&rsquo; Movement in Post-Independence India</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Formation of New Unions:</strong> The post-independence period saw the formation of a number of trade unions such as <strong>Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS)</strong> and <strong>Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU )</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>CITU was formed by Communist Party of India (Marxist), splitting from AITUC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Legislations Framed:</strong> The <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/labour-laws-diluted#:~:text=Industrial%20Units%20will%20be%20exempted,the%20action%20taken%20by%20industries." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Industrial Dispute Act, 1947</strong></a> and <strong>Labour Relations Bill and Trade Unions Bills, 1949</strong> were introduced.</li>
<li><strong>Decline in Strikes:</strong> Between 1947-1960, the condition of the working class improved and there was a decline in the number of strikes.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Recession:</strong> The period of late 1960s saw decline in the wages of the working class; as a result, <strong>disputes in the industrial front increased.</strong></li>
<li><strong>New Economic Policy, 1991:</strong> It introduced <strong>LPG</strong> (Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation).
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Liberalisation <strong>deteriorated the bargaining position of the workers</strong> vis-a-vis capital.</li>
<li>The policy provided <strong>no statutory minimum wages</strong> for labour.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It gave the employers the <strong>complete right to hire and fire.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weaknesses of the Movement</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Incomplete Coverage:</strong> A large section of the working class, the <strong>unorganised sector, was left outside the fold of trade unions.</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The unions took the relatively easy path of pressing the demands of those who could be easily organised or whose demands were likely to be heard by the government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multiplicity of Trade Unions:</strong> Post independence, the trade unions representing workers in the country have multiplied.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Multiplicity of unions in a capitalist system <strong>keeps the working class fragmented and vulnerable to all forms of pressures.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Irresponsive Trade Unions:</strong> Trade unions in the country had not been responsive to the problems of the working class in the country. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Unions lay fragmented which produced bitter rivalry among them and hence very often they failed to respond to the issues of the working class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Disunity among the Workers:</strong> The<strong> industrial working class of the country did not ally with the peasants</strong> and other sections of the society in collective direct action on political issues'.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>This reflected the <strong>lack of political consciousness</strong> among the working class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Negligence for Marginalised Sections:</strong> Trade unions in the organised sector <strong>overlooked the problems of women workers and workers belonging to the socially oppressed groups.</strong></li>
