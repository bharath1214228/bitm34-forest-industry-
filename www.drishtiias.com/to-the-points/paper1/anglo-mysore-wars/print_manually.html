                            <h2>Anglo-Mysore Wars | 25 Jan 2021</h2>
                <p>The Anglo-Mysore Wars was a series of <strong>four military confrontations</strong> in India between the <strong>British and the rulers of Mysore.</strong></p>
<h3>First Anglo-Mysore War (1767-69)</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>In 1612,</strong> a Hindu kingdom under the <strong>Wodeyars</strong> emerged in the region of Mysore. <strong>Chikka Krishnaraja Wodeyar</strong> <strong>II</strong> ruled from <strong>1734 to 1766. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Haider Ali</strong> who was appointed as a soldier in the army of Wodeyars became the<strong> de-facto ruler of Mysore</strong> with his great administrative skills and military tactics.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>During the second half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Mysore emerged as a formidable power under his leadership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mysore&rsquo;s proximity with the French</strong> and<strong> Haidar Ali&rsquo;s control</strong> over the rich trade of the<strong> Malabar coast</strong> threatened the political and commercial interests of the English and their control over Madras.</li>
<li>The British, after their success in the<strong> Battle of Buxar</strong> with the nawab of Bengal, signed a treaty with the <strong>Nizam of Hyderabad</strong> persuading him to give them the <strong>Northern Circars for protecting the Nizam from Haidar Ali</strong> who already had disputes with the <strong>Marathas.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Nizam of Hyderabad, the Marathas, and the English allied together against Haidar Ali.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Haider diplomatically turned the Marathas neutral and Nizam into his ally against Nawab of Arcot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="border-bg">
<p><strong>Haider Ali</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Haider Ali (1721-1782),</strong> born in an obscure family, started his career as a <strong>horseman in the Mysore army</strong> under the ministers of king<strong> Chikka Krishnaraja Wodeyar.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>He was uneducated but <strong>intellectual </strong>and <strong>diplomatically &amp; militarily skilled.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He became the <strong><em>de facto</em> ruler of Mysore in 1761</strong> and <strong>introduced western methods</strong> of training into his army with the <strong>help of the French army.</strong></li>
<li>With his excellent military skills,<strong> he took over the Nizami army and the Marathas</strong> and captured<strong> Dod Ballapur, Sera, Bednur and Hoskote</strong> in 1761- 63 and brought to submission the troublesome<strong> Poligars of South India</strong> (Tamil Nadu).
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Poligars or Palaiyakkarars were appointed as <strong>military chiefs and administrative governors</strong> from the time of the <strong>Vijayanagara Empire</strong> in parts of Southern India. They also collected taxes from the cultivators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recovering from their defeat, the Marathas under <strong>Madhavrao attacked Mysore,</strong> and<strong> defeated Haidar Ali in 1764, 1766, and 1771.</strong></li>
<li>To buy peace, Haidar Ali had to give them large sums of money, but after Madhavrao&rsquo;s death in 1772, <strong>Haidar Ali raided the Marathas</strong> a number of times <strong>during 1774-76,</strong> and <strong>recovered all the territories</strong> he had previously lost, besides <strong>capturing new areas.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Course of War</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The war continued for<strong> a year-and-a-half</strong> without any conclusion.</li>
<li>Haidar changed his strategy and suddenly appeared before the gates of Madras causing complete chaos and panic at Madras.</li>
<li>This forced the English to conclude a<strong> treaty with Haidar on April 4, 1769</strong> known as the <strong>Treaty of Madras.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The treaty provided for the<strong> exchange of prisoners</strong> and the <strong>conquered areas.</strong></li>
<li>Haidar Ali was <strong>promised the help of the English</strong> in case he was attacked by any other power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780-84)</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The British<strong> failed to adhere to the treaty of Madras</strong> when Mysore was attacked by the <strong>Maratha army in 1771.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Haider Ali accused them for breach of faith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moreover,<strong> Haider Ali found the French more resourceful</strong> in terms of fulfilling the army requirements of guns, saltpetre and lead.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Consequently, he started <strong>importing French war materials</strong> to Mysore <strong>through Mahe,</strong> a French possession on the Malabar Coast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The increasing friendship between the two raised concern for the British. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Consequently the British tried to capture Mahe which was under Haider Ali&rsquo;s protection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Course of War</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Haidar Ali forged an <strong>alliance with the Marathas and the Nizam</strong> against the British. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>He<strong> attacked the Carnatic and captured Arcot</strong> and <strong>defeated the English</strong> army under<strong> Colonel Baillie in 1781.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the meantime, the English (<strong>under Sir Eyre Coote) detached both the Marathas and the Nizam from Haidar&rsquo;s side,</strong> but the undeterred Haidar faced the English boldly only to suffer a<strong> defeat at Porto Novo</strong> (present day Parangipettai, Tamil Nadu) <strong>in November 1781.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>However, he regrouped his forces and defeated the English and captured their commander, Braithwaite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Haidar Ali <strong>died of cancer</strong> on<strong> December 7, 1782.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>His son Tipu Sultan carried on the war for one year without any positive outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fed up with an inconclusive war, both sides opted for peace, negotiating the<strong> Treaty of Mangalore (March, 1784)</strong> under which both the parties gave back the territories they had taken from each other.</li>
</ul>
<div class="border-bg">
<p><strong>Tipu Sultan</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Born in <strong>November 1750,</strong> Tipu Sultan was Haidar Ali&rsquo;s son and a <strong>great warrior</strong> also known as the<strong> Tiger of Mysore.</strong></li>
<li>He was a<strong> well educated man</strong> fluent in<strong> Arabic, Persian, Kanarese and Urdu.</strong></li>
<li>Tipu, like his father Haider Ali, gave maximum care to the raising and maintenance of <strong>an efficient military force.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>He organised his <strong>army on the European model with Persian words of command.</strong></li>
<li>Though he took the help of the French officers to train his soldiers, he never allowed them (French) to develop into a pressure group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tipu was well aware of the importance of a naval force. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>In 1796,</strong> he set up a Board of Admiralty and planned for<strong> a fleet of 22 battleships and 20 large frigates.</strong></li>
<li>He established<strong> three dockyards at Mangalore, Wajedabad and Molidabad.</strong> However, his plans did not fructify.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He was also a <strong>patron of science and technology</strong> and is credited as the<strong> &lsquo;pioneer of rocket technology&rsquo;</strong> in India. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>He wrote a military manual explaining the operation of rockets.</li>
<li>He was also a pioneer in <strong>introducing sericulture to the Mysore State.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tipu was a <strong>great lover of democracy and a great diplomat</strong> who gave his support to the French soldiers at Seringapatam in setting up a<strong> Jacobin Club in 1797.</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Tipu himself became a member of the Jacobin Club and allowed himself to be called <strong>Citizen Tipu.</strong></li>
<li>He planted the <strong>Tree of Liberty at Seringapatam.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790-92)</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The Treaty of Mangalore was not enough to resolve the conflicts between Tipu Sultan and the British. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Both were aiming to establish their own political supremacy over the Deccan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Third Anglo-Mysore War</strong> began when<strong> Tipu attacked Travancore,</strong> an ally of the English and the <strong>only source of pepper for the East India Company.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Travancore had purchased Jalkottal and Cannanore from the Dutch in the Cochin state which was a feudatory of Tipu, he considered the act of Travancore as a violation of his sovereign rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Course of War</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The British sided with Travancore and attacked Mysore. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Nizam and the Marathas who were jealous of Tipu&rsquo;s growing power joined the British.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 1790, Tipu Sultan defeated the British army under <strong>General Meadows.</strong></li>
<li>In 1791,<strong> Lord Cornwallis</strong> took the leadership and at the head of a large army marched through <strong>Ambur and Vellore to Bangalore</strong> (captured in March 1791) and from there to<strong> Seringapatam.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Coimbatore fell to them, but they lost it again, and at last with the support of the Marathas and the Nizam, the British attacked Seringapatam for the second time.</li>
<li>Tipu offered serious opposition, but the odds were against him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The war was concluded with the <strong>Treaty of Seringapatam, 1792.</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Under this treaty, nearly <strong>half of the Mysorean territory was taken over</strong> by the alliance of the British, Nizam and the Marathas.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Baramahal, Dindigul and Malabar went to the British,</strong> while the <strong>Marathas</strong> got the regions surrounding the <strong>Tungabhadra and its tributaries</strong> and the <strong>Nizam acquired the areas from Krishna</strong> to beyond the <strong>Pennar.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Besides, a<strong> war damage of three crore rupees</strong> was also taken from Tipu.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Half of the war indemnity was to be paid immediately while the rest was to be given in installments, for which Tipu&rsquo;s two sons were taken as hostages by the English.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Third Anglo-Mysore War destroyed Tipu&rsquo;s dominant position in the south and firmly established British supremacy there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799)</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The period of 1792-99 was used by both the British and Tipu Sultan to recoup their losses. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Tipu fulfilled all the terms of the Treaty of Seringapatam and got his sons released.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 1796, when the Hindu ruler of the Wodeyar dynasty died, Tipu declared himself as the Sultan and decided to avenge his humiliating defeat in the previous war.</li>
<li><strong>In 1798, Lord Wellesley,</strong> an imperialist to the core,<strong> succeeded Sir John Shore</strong> as the new Governor General.</li>
<li>Tipu&rsquo;s growing friendship with the French raised concerns for Wellesley. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Aimed at annihilating Tipu&rsquo;s independent existence, he forced him into submission through the system of <strong>Subsidiary Alliance.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tipu was accused of plotting against the British by sending emissaries to Arabia, Afghanistan and to the Isle of France (Mauritius) and Versailles, with treasonable intent. Tipu&rsquo;s explanation did not satisfy Wellesley thus the fourth Anglo-Mysore war began.</li>
</ul>
<div class="border-bg">
<p><strong>Subsidiary Alliance</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>In 1798, <strong>Lord Wellesley introduced the Subsidiary Alliance</strong> system in India, under which the ruler of the allying Indian state was <strong>compelled to pay a subsidy</strong> for the<strong> maintenance of British army</strong> in return for <strong>getting protection from the British</strong> against their enemies. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It provided for the posting of a<strong> British Resident at the ruler&rsquo;s court</strong> restricting the ruler from employing any European in his service without the approval of the British.</li>
<li>Sometimes the ruler ceded part of his territory instead of paying annual subsidy.</li>
<li>The first Indian ruler to sign the <strong>Subsidiary Alliance was the Nizam of Hydera&shy;bad.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those native princes or rulers who would enter into Subsidiary Alliance were not free to declare war against any other power or enter into negotiations without the con&shy;sent of the British.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The princes who were comparatively strong and powerful were permitted to retain their armies, but their armies were placed under British generals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Subsidiary Alliance was a policy of<strong> non-interference in the internal affairs of the allied state,</strong> but this was a promise seldom kept by the British.</li>
<li>The payment of the arbitrarily-fixed and artificially-bloated subsidy invariably disrupted the economy of the state and impoverished its people.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the British could now maintain a large army at the cost of the Indian states. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>They controlled the defence and foreign relations of the protected ally, and had a powerful force stationed at the very heart of his lands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Course of War</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The war began on <strong>April 17, 1799</strong> and ended on <strong>May 4, 1799</strong> with the fall of Seringapatam. Tipu was defeated first by British General Stuart and then by General Harris.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Arthur Wellesley, the brother of Lord Wellesley, also participated in the war.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Marathas and the Nizam again helped the British as the<strong> Marathas had been promised half of the territory of Tipu</strong> and the<strong> Nizam had already signed the Subsidiary Alliance.</strong></li>
<li>Tipu Sultan died in the war and all his treasures were confiscated by the British.</li>
<li>The British chose a boy from the earlier Hindu royal family of Mysore as the maharaja and also imposed the subsidiary alliance system on him.</li>
<li>It had taken the English 32 years to subjugate Mysore. The threat of French revival in the Deccan was permanently eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post War Scenario</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Lord Wellesley offered <strong>Soonda and Harponelly districts of Mysore Kingdom</strong> to the <strong>Marathas,</strong> which the latter <strong>refused.</strong></li>
<li>The<strong> Nizam</strong> was given the districts of <strong>Gooty and Gurramkonda.</strong></li>
<li>The British took possession of Kanara, <strong>Wayanad, Coimbatore, Dwaraporam and Seringapatam.</strong></li>
<li>The new state of Mysore was handed over to the old Hindu dynasty (Wodeyars) under a minor ruler Krishnaraja III, who accepted the subsidiary alliance.</li>
