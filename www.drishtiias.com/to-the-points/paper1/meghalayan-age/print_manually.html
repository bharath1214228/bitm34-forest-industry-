                            <h2>Meghalayan Age | 01 Jan 2022</h2>
                <h3>Why in News?</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Geologists have decided to classify the <strong>past 4,200 years</strong> as the Meghalayan Age.</li>
<li>It is the<strong> most recent unit</strong> of the <strong>Geologic Time Scale</strong> in the 4.6 billion-year history of the Earth.</li>
<li>Following this, the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, which depicts the timeline for Earth's history will be updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Meghalayan Age?</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>&ldquo;Meghalayan Age&rdquo;</strong> began 4,200 years ago and experienced an<strong> abrupt mega- drought and cooling around the globe.</strong></li>
<li>The drought and the cooling lasted two centuries and severely impacted agricultural-based societies that developed in several regions after the end of the last Ice Age.</li>
<li>It resulted in the <strong>collapse of civilisations</strong> in Egypt, Greece, Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and the Yangtze River Valley.</li>
<li>Evidence of the 4,200-year climatic event has been found on all seven continents.</li>
<li>This age is considered unique as this was the <strong>only age which began with a global cultural event</strong> produced by a <strong>global climatic event.</strong></li>
<li>Geologists have also introduced<strong> two other age classifications</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Greenlandian Age (11,700 - 8,326 years ago)</strong> - began when the last ice age ended and the world began to warm up.</li>
<li><strong>Northgrippian Age (8,326 &ndash; 4,200 years ago)</strong> &ndash; began after an abrupt global cooling started following the Greenlandian Age.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Together, these three stages stretch across the <strong>Holocene Epoch</strong>, which is the current geological time unit - <strong>having started 11,700 years ago.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Holocene Epoch?</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The Holocene epoch falls under <strong>Cenozoic Era</strong> and is the time after <strong>Ice Age</strong>. Each subdivision of the Holocene Epoch is marked out by sediments accumulated on sea floors, lake bottoms, glacial ice and in stalactites and stalagmites across the world.</li>
<li>Clues to the Greenlandian and Northgrippian stages were available at specific levels in Greenland&rsquo;s ice cores (snow turns into ice, and preserves a record of the climate each year). But this method did not work as well for the younger (newer) part of the Holocene as it did for the older (early) part.</li>
<li>Therefore, the younger (newer) part of the <strong>Holocene, i.e. Meghalayan Age division</strong> was marked out by a <strong>deviation in the types, or isotopes, of oxygen atoms</strong> present in the layers of stalagmite rocks of <strong>Mawmluh Cave in Meghalaya.</strong></li>
<li>Both the <strong>ice cores</strong> and the <strong>stalagmite</strong> are now defined as <strong>&ldquo;international geostandards.&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li>The stalagmite has also been tagged a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Points (GSSP), the first formally ratified marker of a geological time period change in India.</li>
<li>Scientists used the geological age dating method to study the rock&rsquo;s age.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Geologists divide the <strong>4.6-billion-year existence of Earth</strong> into slices of time such as <strong>Eon, Era, System/Period, Series/Epoch, and Stage/Age</strong>.</li>
<li>Eons are divided into Eras, Eras into Periods, Periods into Epochs, and Epochs into Ages.</li>
<li><strong>Each slice corresponds to significant happenings</strong> - such as the break-up of continents, dramatic shifts in climate, and even the emergence of particular types of animals and plant life.</li>

<h3>International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)</strong> is the largest and oldest scientific body in the <strong>International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).</strong></li>
<li>It is the official keeper of geologic time, i.e. it precisely defines units (periods, epochs, and age) of the Geologic Time Scale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mawmluh Cave, Meghalaya</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Located at an elevation of 1,290 metres, Mawmluh cave is one of the<strong> longest and deepest caves in India.</strong></li>
<li>The caves provide important record of Holocene palaeoclimate and palaeomonsoon since they are not subjected to diagenesis, erosion and terrestrial deposits.</li>
<li>The conditions here were suitable for preserving chemical signs of oxygen transition in ages.</li>
