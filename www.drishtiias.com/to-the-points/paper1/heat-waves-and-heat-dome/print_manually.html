                            <h2>Heat Waves and Heat Dome | 20 Jul 2021</h2>
                <h3>Why in News</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The Pacific North-west, known for its moderate climate, is experiencing a<strong> &ldquo;historic&rdquo;</strong> heat wave. The heat wave is being described as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-dome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Heat Dome</strong></a>&rdquo;. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It has stretched emergency services, with at least 134 people dying suddenly since the last few days in parts of Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Heat Waves and Heat Dome</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Heat Wave:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>A heat wave is a period of abnormally high temperatures, more than the normal maximum temperature that lasts for more than two days.</li>
<li>Heat waves can occur with or without high humidity and have the potential to cover a large area, exposing a high number of people to <strong>hazardous heat.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increasing Trend of Heat Waves:</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>In the past few decades, heat waves have become larger, <strong>affecting 25% more land area in the <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/autumnal-equinox-in-northern-hemisphere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northern Hemisphere</a></strong> than they did in 1980. </li>
<li>Including the <strong>ocean areas, heat waves have grown by 50%.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Heat Dome:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>A heat dome occurs when the atmosphere traps hot ocean air like a lid or cap.</li>
<li>As per <strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USA,</strong> a heat dome is created when strong high-pressure atmospheric conditions combine with weather patterns like <strong><a href="../el-nino-and-la-nina.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Ni&ntilde;a</a>.</strong> </li>
<li>They are <strong>more likely to form during La Ni&ntilde;a years</strong> like 2021, when waters are cool in the eastern Pacific and warm in the western Pacific. creating vast areas of sweltering. </li>
<li><strong>Duration of Heat Domes:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>According to NOAA, a heat dome typically lasts<strong> a week.</strong> </li>
<li>The formation after a week becomes too bog to keep standing and falls over, releasing the trapped air and ending the swelter. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Causes of Formation of Heat Dome: </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Change in Ocean Temperature:</strong> The phenomenon begins when there is a <strong>strong change (or gradient) in ocean temperatures.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>In the process known as <strong>convection,</strong> the gradient causes more warm air, heated by the ocean surface, to rise over the ocean surface.</li>
<li>As prevailing winds move the hot air east, the northern shifts of the jet stream trap the air and move it toward land, where it sinks, <strong>resulting in heat waves.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Change in Atmospheric Pressure:</strong> Heat waves begin when <strong>high pressure in the atmosphere moves in and pushes warm air</strong> toward the ground. This effect is fuelled by heat rising from the ocean, creating an amplification loop.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The high-pressure system pressing down on the ground expands vertically, forcing other weather systems to change course. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It even minimizes wind and cloud cover, making the air more stifling. </li>
<li>This is also why a heat wave parks itself over an area for several days or longer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> The rising temperatures lead to hotter weather. Heat waves have been a regular phenomenon on land. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>However, <strong>global warming has caused them to be hotter with a longer duration</strong> and an increased frequency.</li>
<li>Scientists studying the climate tend to agree that the heat waves occurring today are more likely to be a result of climate change for which humans are responsible.</li>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Impact of Heat Waves and Heat Domes:</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Risk of Wildfires:</strong> The heat domes act as fuel to <strong><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/forest-fires-a-very-big-concern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfires</a></strong>, which destroys a lot of land area every year in countries like the US.</li>
<li><strong>Prevents Cloud Formation:</strong> The condition also <strong>prevents clouds from forming,</strong> allowing for more radiation from the sun to hit the ground. </li>
<li><strong>Heat Strokes and Sudden Fatalities:</strong> The very high temperatures or humid conditions pose an elevated risk of <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-waves" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>heatstroke</strong></a> or<strong> heat exhaustion.</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Older people and people with chronic illness</strong> such as <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/higher-mortality-from-cardio-vascular-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>heart disease</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/acute-respiratory-infections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>respiratory disease</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/world-diabetes-day-2019#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organisation%20(WHO,is%20%E2%80%9CFamily%20and%20Diabetes%E2%80%9D." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>diabetes</strong></a> are <strong>more susceptible to heatstroke,</strong> as the body&rsquo;s ability to regulate heat deteriorates with age.</li>
<li>Houses without air conditioners experience an unbearable rise in temperature of their home which can lead to<strong> sudden deaths.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Effect on Vegetation:</strong> The trapping of heat can also <strong>damage crops, dry out vegetation</strong> and result in <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/el-niño-drought" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>droughts.</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Increased Energy Demands:</strong> The sweltering heat wave also leads to rise in energy demand, especially electricity, leading to pushing up rates.</li>
<li><strong>Power Related Issues:</strong> Heat waves are often high mortality disasters.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Avoiding heat-related disasters depends on the resilience of the electrical grid, which can fail if electricity demand due to air conditioning use exceeds supply.</li>
<li>As a result, there is the <strong>double risk of infrastructure failure and health impacts.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps for Avoiding Heat Waves</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Individual Level: </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Staying Hydrated:</strong> Staying indoor and at rest in a very dry room with about 10% relative humidity, and drinking water constantly (for producing sweat), can help avoid overheating at temperatures as high as 46℃.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>However, there is a limit to this, called the<strong> wet-bulb temperature,</strong> which considers heat and humidity, beyond which humans cannot tolerate high temperatures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Altering Workout Routines:</strong> Exercising early in the morning when it is still cool or in air conditioned indoor spaces. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Skipping workout routines can also be considered given the extreme heat. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Public Level: </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Public Cooling Shelters:</strong> A number of emergency cooling shelters can be opened so that people without domestic air conditioning units can escape the heat.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Air-conditioned rooms and buildings are the biggest help to people caught under a heat dome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Portable ACs:</strong> Portable air-conditioning units, along with fans and even ice are also useful. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Long Term Solutions: </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Afforestation:</strong> Trees don&rsquo;t just provide much-needed shade for a sweaty city. The water evaporating from their leaves can cool a neighborhood by a few degrees during the hottest periods.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Tree leaves also absorb and filter local air pollution; heat waves can worsen urban smog, which may put comorbids at risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Replacing Dark Roofs:</strong> A big reason that cities are so much hotter than rural areas is that they are covered by dark roofs, roads and parking lots that absorb and retain heat. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Replacing the dark surfaces with lighter more reflective materials will result in a comparatively cooler environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Preparing for the Blackout:</strong> A widespread blackout during a heat wave can leave millions of people without electricity for fans or air-conditioners. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Smarter grids and new forecasting tools could help electric utilities prepare for heat waves. </li>
<li>Using electronic controls to pre-cool buildings before temperatures peak in the daytime.</li>
