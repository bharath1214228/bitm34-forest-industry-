<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Act<strong> introduced diarchy (rule of two individuals/parties) for the executive</strong> at the level of the provincial government.</li>
<li>The diarchy was implemented in eight provinces:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, Central Provinces, United Provinces, Bombay, Madras and Punjab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>provincial governments were given more powers</strong> under the system of Dyarchy.</li>
<li>The <strong>governor was to be the executive head in the province.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Division of Subjects:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Subjects were divided into two lists: <strong>&lsquo;reserved&rsquo;</strong> and <strong>&lsquo;transferred&rsquo;.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The <strong>reserved list,</strong> under which the <strong>subjects were to be administered by the governor</strong> through his executive council of bureaucrats. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It included subjects such as law and order, finance, land revenue, irrigation etc.</li>
<li><strong>All important subjects were kept in the reserved subjects</strong> of the Provincial Executive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The transferred subjects were to be <strong>administered by ministers nominated from among the elected members</strong> of the legislative council.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It included subjects such as education, health, local government, industry, agriculture, excise, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In case of <strong>failure of constitutional machinery</strong> in the province the<strong> governor could take over the administration</strong> of transferred subjects also.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Restriction in Interference:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The <strong>Secretary Of State for India</strong> and the<strong> Governor General</strong> could interfere in respect of reserved subjects while in respect of the transferred subjects, the scope for their interference was restricted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reforms in Legislature:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Provincial legislative councils were further expanded and <strong>70% of the members were to be elected.</strong></li>
<li>The system of <strong>communal and class electorates</strong> was further consolidated.</li>
<li><strong>Women were also given the right to vote.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>legislative councils could reject the budget</strong> but the<strong> governor could restore it, if necessary. </strong></li>
<li>The <strong>legislators enjoyed freedom of speech.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Powers of the Governor:</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Governor could overrule the ministers on any grounds that he considered special. Also, he retained complete control over the finances.</li>
<li>The legislative councils could initiate legislation but the governor&rsquo;s assent was required.</li>
<li>The <strong>governor could veto bills and issue ordinances.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Significance of the Act</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Awakening Among Indians:</strong> Indians received secret information about administration and became aware of their duties. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>This<strong> instilled a sense of nationalism and awakening among Indians</strong> and they <strong>moved towards achieving the goal of Swaraj. </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Voting Rights:</strong> Election areas expanded in India and <strong>people began to understand the importance of voting. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Self Government in Provinces:</strong> The Act<strong> led to the existence of provincial self-government</strong> in India. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Act <strong>gave the people the power to administer</strong> and administrative pressure from the government was greatly reduced.</li>
<li><strong>It prepared Indians to discharge responsibilities</strong> in the provincial administration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drawbacks of the Act</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Irresponsible Central Government:</strong> No responsible government was envisaged in the Act at the all-India level.</li>
<li><strong>Spread of Communalism:</strong> The flawed electoral system and limited franchise failed to gain popularity. It promoted a sense of communalism in a separate electoral system.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Extension of Electorates:</strong> The electorate was extended to some one-and-a-half million for the central legislature, while the population of India was around 260 million, as per one estimate.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Administrative Control:</strong> At the centre, the legislature had no control over the viceroy and his executive council. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The <strong>provincial ministers had no control over finances</strong> and over the bureaucrats; this would lead to constant friction between the two.</li>
<li>Ministers were often not consulted on important matters too and could be overruled by the governor on any matter that the latter considered special.</li>
<li>The <strong>Governor enjoyed unrestricted powers,</strong> he could also take a decision against the decision of his council and ministers. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Almost all important matters related to administration depended on the governor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inappropriate Division of Subjects:</strong> Division of subjects was not satisfactory at the centre. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The <strong>central legislature was given very little power and no control over finances.</strong></li>
<li>At the level of provinces, division of subjects and parallel administration of two parts was irrational and, hence, unworkable. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Subjects like irrigation, finance, police, press and justice were &lsquo;reserved&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Outcomes of the Act</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Public Reaction:</strong> The Congress met in a special session in August 1918 at Bombay under <strong>Hasan Imam&rsquo;s</strong> presidency and <strong>declared the reforms to be &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo; and demanded effective self-government instead.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Montford reforms were termed <strong>&ldquo;unworthy and disappointing - a sunless dawn&rdquo; by <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bal-gangadhar-tilak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bal Gangadhar Tilak</a>. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Annie Besant</strong> found the reforms <strong>&ldquo;unworthy of England to offer and India to accept&rdquo;.</strong></li>
<li>Veteran Congress leaders led by Surendranath Banerjea were<strong> in favour of accepting the government proposals.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Encouraged the Struggle for Power:</strong> The Act encouraged the struggle for power in both Indians and the British. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>As a result a large number of communal riots took place which continued to increase from 1922 to 1927.</li>
<li>The <strong>Swaraj Party was founded in 1923</strong> and won a substantial number of seats in the elections, except Madras. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Whereas in Bombay and Central Provinces were successful in blocking the majority of other supplies with the salaries of ministers.</li>
<li>Thus the governors of both the provinces were <strong>forced to abolish the diarchy regime</strong> and took the transferred subjects under their control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enactment of the Rowlatt Act:</strong> While trying to appease Indians, the Government of India was ready with repression. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Throughout the war, repression of nationalists had continued. The terrorists and revolutionaries had been hunted down, hanged and imprisoned. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Many other nationalists such as <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/70-years-of-indian-council-for-cultural-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Maulana Abul Kalam Azad</strong> </a>had also been kept behind bars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The government now decided to arm itself with more far-reaching powers, which went against the accepted principles of rule of law, to be able to suppress those nationalists who would refuse to be satisfied with the official reforms.</li>
<li><strong>In March 1919</strong> it passed the<a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/100-years-of-rowlatt-satyagraha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Rowlatt Act</strong> </a>even though every single Indian member of the Central Legislative Council opposed it.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>This <strong>Act authorized the government to imprison any person without trial and conviction in a court of law.</strong></li>
<li>The Act enabled the government to suspend the right of <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/habeas-corpus-cases-in-jammu-kashmir" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Habeas Corpus</strong></a> which had been the foundation of civil liberties in Britain.</li>
