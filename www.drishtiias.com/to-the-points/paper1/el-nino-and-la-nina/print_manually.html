                            <h2>El Nino and La Nina | 18 Jan 2021</h2>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>El Nino and La Nina</strong> are complex weather patterns resulting from variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific Region. They are opposite phases of what is known as the<strong> El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</strong> cycle. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The ENSO cycle describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific.</li>
<li>El Nino and La Nina episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>El Nino</strong> is a climate pattern that describes the<strong> unusual warming of surface waters</strong> in the <strong>eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It is the &ldquo;warm phase&rdquo; of a larger phenomenon called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</li>
<li>It occurs more frequently than La Nina.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>La Nina, the &ldquo;cool phase&rdquo;</strong> of ENSO, is a pattern that describes the <strong>unusual cooling</strong> of the tropical eastern Pacific. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>La Nina events may last between <strong>one and three years, unlike El Nino,</strong> which usually lasts no more than a year.</li>
<li><strong>Both phenomena tend to peak during the Northern Hemisphere winter.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>El Nino</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>El Nino was<strong> first recognized by Peruvian fishermen</strong> off the coast of Peru as the appearance of unusually warm water. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Spanish immigrants called it <strong>El Nino, meaning &ldquo;the little boy&rdquo;</strong> in Spanish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>El Nino soon came to describe irregular and intense climate changes rather than just the warming of coastal surface waters.</li>
<li>The El Nino event is<strong> not a regular cycle,</strong> they are not predictable and occur irregularly at two- to seven-year intervals. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The climatologists determined that El Nino occurs simultaneously with the Southern Oscillation. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The Southern Oscillation is a change in air pressure over the tropical Pacific Ocean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When coastal waters become warmer in the eastern tropical Pacific (El Nino), the atmospheric pressure above the ocean decreases.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Climatologists define these linked phenomena as <strong>El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring El Nino and La Nina</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Scientists, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) collect data about El Nino using a number of technologies such as<strong> scientific buoys.</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>A buoy is a type of an <strong>object that floats in water</strong> and is used in the middle of the <strong>seas as locators or as warning points for the ships.</strong> They are generally bright (fluorescent) in colour.</li>
<li>These buoys measure ocean and air temperatures, currents, winds, and humidity.</li>
<li>The buoys transmit data daily to researchers and forecasters around the world enabling the scientists to more accurately predict El Nino and visualize its development and impact around the globe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Oceanic Nino Index (ONI)</strong> is used to measure deviations from normal sea surface temperatures.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The intensity of El Nino events varies from weak temperature increases (about 4-5&deg; F) with only moderate local effects on weather and climate to very strong increases (14-18&deg; F) associated with worldwide climatic changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="border-bg">
<p><strong>Oceanic Nino Index (ONI)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>Oceanic Ni&ntilde;o Index (ONI),</strong> is a measure of the departure from normal sea surface temperature in the east-central Pacific Ocean, is the standard means by which each El Nino episode is determined, gauged, and forecast.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Impact of El Nino</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>In order to understand the concept of El Nino, it&rsquo;s important to be familiar with non-El Nino conditions in the Pacific Ocean. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Normally,<strong> strong trade winds blow westward</strong> across the tropical Pacific, the region of the Pacific Ocean located between the <strong>Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Ocean:</strong> El Nino also impacts ocean temperatures, the speed and strength of ocean currents, the health of coastal fisheries, and local weather from Australia to South America and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Rainfall:</strong> Convection above warmer surface waters brings increased precipitation. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Rainfall increases drastically in South America, contributing to coastal flooding and erosion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diseases caused by Floods and Droughts:</strong> Diseases thrive in communities devastated by natural hazards such as flood or drought. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>El Nino-related flooding is associated with increases in cholera, dengue, and malaria in some parts of the world, while drought can lead to wildfires that create respiratory problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Positive impact:</strong> It can sometimes have a positive impact too, for example, El Nino reduces the instances of hurricanes in the Atlantic.</li>
<li><strong>In South America:</strong> As El Nino brings rain to South America, it brings droughts to Indonesia and Australia. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>These droughts threaten the region&rsquo;s water supplies, as reservoirs dry and rivers carry less water. Agriculture, which depends on water for irrigation, is also threatened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In Western Pacific:</strong> These winds<strong> push warm surface water</strong> towards the western Pacific, where it borders <strong>Asia and Australia.</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Due to the warm trade winds, the sea surface is normally about <strong>0.5 meter higher </strong>and<strong> 4-5&deg; F warmer in Indonesia than Ecuador.</strong></li>
<li>The westward movement of warmer waters causes<strong> cooler waters to rise up</strong> towards the surface on the coasts of<strong> Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.</strong> This process is known as <strong>upwelling.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Upwelling elevates cold, nutrient-rich water to the euphotic zone, the upper layer of the ocean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Previous El Nino Events:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>El Nino events of <strong>1982-83 and 1997-98</strong> were the <strong>most intense</strong> of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
<li>During the<strong> 1982-83</strong> event, sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific were 9-18&deg; F above normal.</li>
<li>The El Nino event of <strong>1997-98</strong> was the first El Nino event to be<strong> scientifically monitored from beginning to end.</strong></li>
<li>The 1997-98 event produced drought conditions in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Peru and California experienced very heavy rains and severe flooding.</li>
<li>The Midwest experienced record-breaking warm temperatures during a period known as <strong>&ldquo;the year without a winter.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>La Nina</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>La Nina means The Little Girl in Spanish. It is also sometimes called El Viejo, anti-El Nino, or simply "a cold event."</li>
<li>La Nina events represent periods of <strong>below-average sea surface temperatures</strong> across the <strong>east-central Equatorial Pacific.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It is indicated by sea-surface temperature decreased by more than 0.9â„‰ for at least five successive three-month seasons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>La Nina event is observed when the<strong> water temperature in the Eastern Pacific gets comparatively colder than normal,</strong> as a consequence of which, there is a <strong>strong high pressure over the eastern equatorial Pacific. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Conditions of La Nina.</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>La Nina is caused by a build-up of<strong> cooler-than-normal waters in the tropical Pacific,</strong> the area of the Pacific Ocean between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.</li>
<li>La Nina is characterized by<strong> lower-than-normal air pressure over the western Pacific.</strong> These low-pressure zones contribute to increased rainfall.</li>
<li>La Nina events are also associated with<strong> rainier-than-normal conditions</strong> over <strong>southeastern Africa and northern Brazil.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>However, strong La Nina events are associated with catastrophic floods in northern Australia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>La Nina is also characterized by <strong>higher-than-normal pressure</strong> over the <strong>central and eastern Pacific.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>This results in decreased cloud production and rainfall in that region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drier-than-normal conditions</strong> are observed along the <strong>west coast of tropical South America, </strong>the <strong>Gulf Coast of the United States,</strong> and the <strong>pampas region of southern South America.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of La Nina</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Europe:</strong> In Europe, El Nino reduces the number of autumnal hurricanes. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>La Nina tends to lead to <strong>milder winters in Northern Europe</strong> (especially UK) and colder <strong>winters in southern/western Europe</strong> leading to snow in the Mediterranean region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>North America:</strong> It is continental North America where most of these conditions are felt. The wider effects include:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Stronger winds along the equatorial region,</strong> especially in the Pacific.</li>
<li><strong>Favourable conditions for hurricanes</strong> in the Caribbean and central Atlantic area.</li>
<li><strong>Greater instances of tornados</strong> in various states of the US.</li>
<li><strong>South America:</strong> La Nina causes<strong> drought in the</strong> South American countries of <strong>Peru and Ecuador.</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It usually has a <strong>positive impact on the fishing industry</strong> of western South America.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Western Pacific:</strong> In the western Pacific, La Nina increases the<strong> potential for landfall</strong> in those areas most vulnerable to their effects, and especially into <strong>continental Asia and China.</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It also leads to<strong> heavy floods in Australia.</strong></li>
<li>There are<strong> increased temperatures</strong> in Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and off the Somalian coast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="border-bg">
<p><strong>La Nina in 2010</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The 2010 La Nina event correlates with one of the worst floods in the history of Queensland, Australia.</li>
<li>More than 10,000 people were forced to evacuate, and damage from the disaster was estimated at more than $2 billion.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>ENSO and India</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>El Nino:</strong> Strong El Nino events contribute to weaker monsoons and even droughts in India Southeast Asia.</li>
<li><strong>La Nina:</strong> The cold air occupies a larger part of India than the El Nino cold air.</li>
<li>In the &lsquo;La Nina year&rsquo;, <strong>rainfall associated with the summer monsoon</strong> in Southeast Asia tends to be <strong>greater than normal,</strong> especially in<strong> northwest India and Bangladesh.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>This generally <strong>benefits the Indian economy,</strong> which depends on the monsoon for agriculture and industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It usually brings in <strong>colder than normal winters</strong> in India.</li>
<li>La Nina influences the Indian subcontinent by piping in<strong> cold air from Siberia and South China,</strong> which interacts with the tropical heating to produce a north-south low-pressure system.</li>
<li>The <strong>cold air of La Nina</strong> associated with this north-south trough <strong>tends to extend much further south into India.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>This is remarkably different from the more northwest-southeast blast of cold air associated with El Nino.</li>
<li>The pressure pattern going north-south means lesser impact of western disturbances.</li>
<li>The <strong>cold temperature can go down as far as Tamil Nadu, </strong>but <strong>may not affect the North East that much.</strong></li>
</ul>
