                            <h2>Mauryan Art and Architecture- Part 1 | 22 Oct 2019</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The Great Mauryan ruler <strong>Ashoka</strong> embraced <strong>Buddhism</strong> (as a part of shraman tradition) and the immense Buddhist missionary activities that followed during his rule paved the way for the development of <strong>Mauryan sculptural</strong> and <strong>architectural styles.</strong></li>
<li>King Ashoka patronized the <strong>shraman tradition</strong> in the third century BCE. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The shraman tradition refers to several Indian religious movements parallel to but separate from the historical vedic religion.</li>
<li>It includes <strong>Jainism, Buddhism,</strong> and others such as <strong>Ajivikas,</strong> and <strong>Carvakas.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>In 321 BC, <strong>Chandragupta Maurya,</strong> with the help of <strong>Chanakya</strong> (author of Arthashasthra) founded the <strong>Mauryan dynasty</strong> after overthrowing <strong>Nanda Dynasty.</strong></li>
<li>The Mauryan Empire was the first most powerful Indian empire to bring the entire Indian subcontinent under a single rule.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Mauryan empire under Chandragupta Maurya spread its boundaries into Central Asia and Persia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Mauryan Empire:</strong> Chandragupta Maurya was succeeded by his son<strong> Bindusara</strong> in 298 BC who expanded the kingdom over most of present-day India, except Kalinga.</li>
<li><strong>Mauryan Dynasty under Ashoka:</strong> Bindusara's kingdom was inherited by his son Ashoka the Great in 274 B.C.</li>
<li><strong>Kalinga Invasion:</strong> During the invasion of Kalinga, Ashoka renounced bloodshed and adopted the policy of Ahimsa and adopted Buddhism.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mauryan Art and Architecture</h3>
<p>Mauryan architecture can be divided into Court Art and Popular Art.</p>
<p><a href="../../../images/uploads/1571745714_image17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="content-img" src="../../../images/uploads/1571745714_image17.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" caption="false" width="504" height="345" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mauryan Court Art:</strong> Implies architectural works (in the form of pillars, stupas and palaces) commissioned by Mauryan rulers for political as well as religious reasons.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Palaces:</strong> Greek historian,<strong> Megasthenes,</strong> described the palaces of the Mauryan empire as one of the greatest creations of mankind and Chinese traveler <strong>Fa Hien</strong> called Mauryan palaces as god gifted monuments.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Persian Influence:</strong> The palace of Chandragupta Maurya was inspired by the <strong>Achaemenid palaces</strong> at Persepolis in Iran.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Material Used: Wood</strong> was the principal building material used during the Mauryan Empire.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> The Mauryan capital at <strong>Pataliputra,</strong> Ashoka&rsquo;s palace at <strong>Kumrahar, Chandragupta Maurya&rsquo;s palace.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pillars:</strong> Ashoka pillars, (usually made of <strong>chunar sandstone</strong>), as a symbol of the state, assumed a great significance in the entire Mauryan Empire.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> The main objective was to disseminate the <strong>Buddhist ideology</strong> and <strong>court orders</strong> in the entire Mauryan empire.</li>
<li><strong>Language:</strong> While most Ashoka pillar edicts were in <strong>Pali</strong> and <strong>Prakrit</strong> language, few were written in <strong>Greek or Aramaic</strong> language also.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture</strong>: Mauryan pillars mainly comprise of four parts:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Shaft:</strong> A long shaft formed the base and was made up of a single piece of stone or monolith.</li>
<li><strong>Capital:</strong> On top of shaft lay the capital, which was either lotus-shaped or bell-shaped.</li>
<li><strong>Abacus:</strong> Above the capital, there was a circular or rectangular base known as the abacus.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Figure:</strong> All the capital figures (usually animals like a bull, lion, elephant, etc) are vigorous and carved standing on a square or circular abacus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Similarities with Persian (Achamenian) Pillars</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Polished Stones and Motifs:</strong> Both Maurya and Achaemenian pillars, used polished stones and have certain common sculpture motifs such as the lotus.</li>
<li><strong>Proclamations:</strong> Maurya&rsquo;s idea of inscribing proclamations (related to Buddhist teachings and court orders) on pillars has its origin in Persian pillars.</li>
<li><strong>Third Person:</strong> Inscriptions of both empires begin in the third person and then move to the first person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Differences with Persian (Achamenian) Pillars<a href="../../../images/uploads/1571745819_image22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="content-img" src="../../../images/uploads/1571745819_image22.jpg" style="float: right;" width="152" height="174" caption="false" /></a></strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>The Capital Figure:</strong> It was absent in Mauryan pillars of the Kumhrar hall whereas pillars at Persepolis have the elaborate capital figures.</li>
<li><strong>The Shape and Ornamentation:</strong> The shape of Mauryan lotus is different from the Persian pillar.</li>
<li><strong>Pillar Surface:</strong> Most of the Persian pillars have a fluted/ ridged surface while the Mauryan pillars have a smooth surface.</li>
<li><strong>Architectural Scheme:</strong> The Achaemenid pillars were generally part of some larger architectural scheme, and bit complex and complicated, while the Ashokan pillars were simple and independent freestanding monuments.</li>
<li><strong>Shaft:</strong> Unlike Mauryan shafts which are built of monolith (single piece of stone), Persian/Achaemenian shafts were built of separate segments of stones (aggregated one above the other).</li>
