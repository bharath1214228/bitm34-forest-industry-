                            <h2>Peasant Movements in India | 12 Jul 2021</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Peasant Struggles:</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In these struggles, the peasants emerged as the main force, fighting directly for their own demands.</li>
<li>The movements in the period between 1858 and 1914 tended to remain localised, disjointed and confined to particular grievances, contrary to the movements after 1914.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Causes of the Movements: </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Peasant Atrocities:</strong> The peasants suffered from<strong> high rents, illegal levies, arbitrary evictions and unpaid labour</strong> in Zamindari areas. The Government levied heavy land revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Massive Losses for Indian Industries:</strong> The movements arose when <strong>British economic policies resulted in the ruin of traditional handicrafts and other small industries</strong> leading to change of ownership and overburdening of agrarian land, and massive debt and impoverishment of peasantry.</li>
<li><strong>Unfavourable Policies:</strong> The economic policies of British government used to <strong>protect the landlords and moneylenders and exploited the peasants.</strong> The peasants rose in revolt against this injustice on many occasions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Peasant Organisations:</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Between 1920 and 1940 peasant organisations arose.</li>
<li>The first organisation to be founded was the <strong>Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha</strong> (1929) and in 1936 the<strong> All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS).</strong></li>
<li>In 1936, at the <a href="../important-indian-national-congress-sessions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Lucknow session of the Congress</strong></a>, <strong>All India Kisan Sabha</strong> was formed with<strong> Sahajanand</strong> as its first president.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>It later issued a <strong>Kisan manifesto</strong> which demanded abolition of zamindari and occupancy rights for all tenants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>19<sup>th</sup> Peasant Movements (Pre-Gandhian Phase)</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Indigo Rebellion (1859-62):</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In order to increase their profits, the European planters persuaded the peasants to plant Indigo instead of food crops.</li>
<li>The farmers were discontent growing indigo because: <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Low prices were offered for growing indigo.</li>
<li>Indigo was not lucrative.</li>
<li>Indigo planting decreased the fertility of the soil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The peasants suffered at the hands of the traders and the middleman. Consequently, they launched a movement for non cultivation of indigo in Bengal.</li>
<li>They were<strong> supported by the press and the missionaries. </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Harish Chandra Mukherjee,</strong> a Bengali Journalist, described the plight of peasants of Bengal in his newspaper <strong>&lsquo;The Hindu Patriot&rsquo;. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Dinabandhu Mitra,</strong> Bengali writer and dramatist, in his play<strong> &lsquo;Nil Darpan&rsquo;</strong> depicted the treatment of the Indian peasantry by the indigo planters. It was first published in 1860. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>His play created a huge controversy which was later banned by the East India Company to control the agitation among the Indians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The government appointed an <strong>Indigo Commission</strong> and issued an order in November 1860, notifying that it was illegal to force the ryots to cultivate indigo. <strong>This marked the victory for the peasants. </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pabna Movement (1870s-80s):</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In larger parts of Eastern <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bengal-partition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Bengal</strong></a>, landlords forcefully collected rents and land taxes, often enhanced for the poor peasants.</li>
<li>The peasants were also prevented from acquiring<strong> Occupancy Right under Act X of 1859.</strong></li>
<li>In May 1873 an <strong>Agrarian League was formed in the Yusufshahi Pargana</strong> of Pabna district, Patna (East Bengal).<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Rent strikes were organised, funds were raised and the struggle spread throughout Patna and to other districts of East Bengal.</li>
<li>The struggle was <strong>mainly legal resistance and little violence.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The discontent continued till 1885 when the Government by the <strong>Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885</strong> enhanced the occupancy rights.</li>
<li>The struggle was supported by <strong><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bankim-chandra-chattopadhyay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bankim Chandra Chatterjee</a>, R.C. Dutt </strong>and the<strong> Indian Association </strong>under <strong>Surendranath Banerjea. </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deccan Riots (1875):</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Deccan peasants uprising was directed mainly against the excesses of the <strong>Marwari</strong> and <strong>Gujarati money lenders.</strong></li>
<li>The ryots suffered heavy taxation under the <a href="../land-revenue-systems-in-british-india.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20Ryotwari%20system%2C%20the,as%20they%20paid%20the%20rent." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ryotwari system</strong></a>. The land revenue was also raised by 50% in 1867.</li>
<li><strong>Social Boycott:</strong> In 1874, the ryots organised a<strong> social boycott movement</strong> against the moneylenders.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>They refused to buy from the moneylenders&rsquo; shops and cultivate their fields.</li>
<li>The barbers, washermen, and shoemakers refused to serve them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This social boycott spread rapidly to the villages of Poona, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Satara and was transformed into agrarian riots with systematic attacks on the moneylenders&rsquo; houses and shops.</li>
<li>The Government succeeded in repressing the movement. As a conciliatory measure, the <strong>Deccan Agriculturists Relief Act</strong> was passed in 1879.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>20<sup>th</sup> Century Peasant Movements (Gandhian Phase)</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Champaran Satyagraha (1917):</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The peasantry on the indigo plantations in the <strong>Champaran</strong> district of Bihar was excessively oppressed by the European planters and compelled to grow indigo on at least 3/20<sup>th</sup> of their land and sell it at prices fixed by the planters.</li>
<li>In 1917, <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/mahatma-gandhi-jayanti#:~:text=2nd%20October%202020%20was,of%20the%20Nation%20%2D%20Mahatma%20Gandhi.&amp;text=Gandhi%20was%20a%20social%20reformist,of%20nonviolent%20resistance%20called%20Satyagrah." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong></a> reached Champaran and began to conduct a detailed inquiry into the condition of the peasantry.</li>
<li>He defied the orders of district officials for leaving Champaran.</li>
<li>In June 1917, the Government appointed an enquiry committee with Gandhiji as one of the members. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The enactment of the <strong>Champaran Agrarian Act, 1918</strong> freed the tenants from the special imposts levied by the indigo planters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Kheda Satyagraha (1918):</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It was chiefly <strong>directed against the Government.</strong></li>
<li>In 1918, the crops failed in the <strong>Kheda district of Gujarat</strong> but the government refused to remit land revenue and insisted on its full collection.</li>
<li>Gandhiji along with<a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/statue-of-unity-1#:~:text=Sardar%20Patel%20is%20credited%20with,tallest%20statue%20in%20the%20world." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Sardar Vallabhai Patel</strong></a> supported the peasants and advised them to withhold payment of revenues till their demand for its remission was met.</li>
<li>The satyagraha lasted till June 1918. The Government conceded the demands of the peasants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Moplah Rebellion (1921):</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The <strong><a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/moplah-uprising#:~:text=The%20Revolt%3A%20Fuelled%20by%20the,British%20and%20the%20Hindu%20landlords." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moplahs</a> were the Muslim tenants</strong> inhabiting the Malabar region where most of the landlords were Hindus.</li>
<li>Their grievances centred around<strong> lack of security of tenure, high rents, renewal fees</strong> and other oppressive exactions.</li>
<li>The Moplah movement merged with the ongoing <a href="../khilafat-and-non-cooperation-movement.html#:~:text=Introduction,%2Dviolence%20and%20non%2Dcooperation." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Khilafat agitation.</strong></a> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Mahatma Gandhi, <strong>Shaukat Ali and <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-education-day#:~:text=Maulana%20Abul%20Kalam%20Azad%20%3A,fighter%2C%20scholar%20and%20eminent%20educationist.&amp;text=He%20was%20posthumously%20awarded%20Bharat,highest%20civilian%20award%20in%201992." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maulana Abul Kalam Azad</a></strong> addressed Moplah meetings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many Hindus were seen by the Moplahs to be helping the British authorities. The anti-government and anti-landlord movement <strong>acquired communal overtones.</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Communalisation isolated the Moplah from the Khilafat &amp; <a href="../khilafat-and-non-cooperation-movement.html#:~:text=Introduction,%2Dviolence%20and%20non%2Dcooperation." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Non-Cooperation Movement.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The movement was called off by December 1921.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bardoli Satyagraha (1928):</strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Enhancement of land revenue by 30% in the Bardoli district of Gujarat by the British government led to the organisation of a <strong>&lsquo;No-Revenue Campaign&rsquo;</strong> by the Bardoli peasants under the<strong> leadership of Vallabhai Patel.</strong></li>
<li>A woman in Bardoli <strong>gave Vallabhai Patel the title of &lsquo;Sardar&rsquo;.</strong></li>
<li>Unsuccessful attempts of the British to suppress the movement by large scale attachment of cattle and land resulted in the appointment of an enquiry committee.</li>
<li>The enquiry came to the conclusion that the increase had been unjustified and reduced the enhancement to 6.03%.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significance of the Movements</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Awareness among the Indians:</strong> Though these revolts were not aimed at uprooting the British rule from India, they created awareness among the Indians. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The peasants<strong> developed a strong awareness of their legal rights</strong> and asserted them in and outside the courts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inspired other Revolts:</strong> They felt a <strong>need to organise and fight against exploitation and oppression.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>These rebellions prepared the ground for various other uprisings such as<strong> Sikh Wars in Punjab</strong> and finally the <strong><a href="../revolt-of-1857.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolt of 1857</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unity Among the Peasantry:</strong> Because of the non-differentiation in the peasantry, and the all-embracing nature of the anti imperialist struggle, the Peasant Movement was able to <strong>unite all sections of the peasantry including the landless labourers</strong> and its anti-feudal and anti-imperialist crusade.</li>
<li><strong>Peasants&rsquo; Voices were Heard:</strong> Due to the peasants fighting directly for their own demands, their voices were heard.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In the Indigo rebellion, Bardoli Satyagraha, Pabna movement and Deccan riots, the demands of peasants were responded to.</li>
<li>Formation of various Kisan Sabhas to hear the peasants' demands during the Non Cooperation Movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Growth of Nationalism:</strong> The ideology of non-violence had given much strength to the peasants who participated in the movement. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The movement also contributed to the growth of nationalism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Encouraged Post-Independence Reforms:</strong> These movements created an atmosphere for post- independence agrarian reforms, for instance, &rsquo;<strong>abolition of Zamindari.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>They eroded the power of the landed class, thus adding to the transformation of the agrarian structure.</li>
