                            <h2>Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movement | 21 Jun 2021</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Mass Movements:</strong> Two mass movements were organized in 1919-1922 to oppose the British rule in India are the <strong>Khilafat movement and the Non-Cooperation movement.</strong> <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The movements, despite having different issues, adopted a unified plan of action of <strong>non-violence and non-cooperation.</strong></li>
<li>This time period saw the <strong>unification of Congress and the Muslim League.</strong> Many political demonstrations took place with the joint effort of both these parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Causes of the Movements:</strong> The following factors served as the background to the two movements: <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Government Hostilities:</strong> The <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/100-years-of-rowlatt-satyagraha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rowlatt Act</strong></a>, the imposition of martial law in Punjab and the <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/jallianwala-bagh-massacre-3#:~:text=The%20Jallianwala%20Bagh%20massacre%20took,fire%20into%20an%20unarmed%20crowd." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Jallianwalla Bagh massacre</strong> </a>exposed the brutal and uncivilised face of the foreign rule. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/current-affairs-news-analysis-editorials/news-analysis/08-04-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hunter Commission</strong> </a>on the Punjab atrocities proved to be eyewash.</li>
<li>The House of Lords (of the British Parliament) endorsed General Dyer&rsquo;s action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discontented Indians:</strong> The <a href="../government-of-india-act-1919.html#:~:text=In%201918%2C%20Edwin%20Montagu%2C%20the,came%20into%20force%20in%201921." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms</strong> </a>with their ill- conceived scheme of Dyarchy failed to satisfy the rising demand of the Indians for self-government.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Hardships:</strong> The economic situation of the country in the post-War years had become alarming with a rise in prices of commodities, decrease in production of Indian industries, increase in burden of taxes and rents etc. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Almost all sections of society suffered economic hardship due to the war and this strengthened the anti-British attitude.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Khilafat (Caliphate) Issue</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Turkey&rsquo;s Alliance against British:</strong> The Muslims all over the world, including India, regarded the sultan of Turkey as their spiritual leader, Khalifa (Caliph). <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>During the First World War, Turkey had allied with Germany and Austria against the British.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discontented Indian Muslims:</strong> The Indian Muslims supported the government during the First World War with an understanding that the sacred places of Ottoman Empire would be in the hands of Khalifa. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>However, after the War, the <strong>Ottoman Empire was divided, Turkey was dismembered and the Khalifa was removed from power.</strong></li>
<li>This angered the Muslims who took it as an insult to the Khalifa. The Ali brothers, <strong>Shoukat Ali and Mohammad Ali</strong> started the Khilafat Movement against the British government. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>This movement took place between 1919 and 1924.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Khilafat Committee:</strong> In early 1919, the<strong> All India Khilafat Committee</strong> was formed under the leadership of the <strong>Ali brothers, <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-education-day#:~:text=Maulana%20Abul%20Kalam%20Azad%20%3A,fighter%2C%20scholar%20and%20eminent%20educationist.&amp;text=He%20was%20posthumously%20awarded%20Bharat,highest%20civilian%20award%20in%201992." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maulana Abul Kalam Azad</a>, Ajmal Khan and Hasrat Mohani,</strong> to force the British Government to change its attitude to Turkey. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Thus, the grounds for a country-wide agitation was prepared.</li>
<li>An <strong>All India Khilafat Conference</strong> was held in Delhi in November 1919 and the call was made to boycott the British goods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Demands of Indian Muslims:</strong> In India, the Muslims demanded from the British that:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Khalifa&rsquo;s control over Muslim sacred places should be retained.</li>
<li>The Khalifa should be left with sufficient territories after territorial arrangements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Congress&rsquo; Initial Stand:</strong> The support of the Congress was essential for the Khilafat movement to succeed. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Although <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/mahatma-gandhi-jayanti#:~:text=2nd%20October%202020%20was,of%20the%20Nation%20%2D%20Mahatma%20Gandhi.&amp;text=Gandhi%20was%20a%20social%20reformist,of%20nonviolent%20resistance%20called%20Satyagrah." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> </a>was in favour of launching Satyagraha and non-cooperation against the Government on the Khilafat issue, the <strong>Congress was not united on this form of political action.</strong></li>
<li>The Congress, later, felt inclined to provide its support as it was a <strong>golden opportunity to unite the Hindus and Muslims </strong>and to bring Muslim participation in such mass movements.</li>
<li>The Muslim League also decided to give full support to the Congress and its agitation on political questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Non-Cooperation Khilafat Movement</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Role of Mahatma Gandhi: </strong><br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Beginning of the Gandhian Movements:</strong> The Non-Cooperation Movement was the beginning of the Gandhian Movement against the British.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and started organising peasants and labourers protests, such as those in <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/mains-practice-question/question-663#:~:text=Kheda%20Satyagraha%3A%20In%20Kheda%2C%20on,for%20revenue%20remission%20in%201918.&amp;text=Sardar%20Vallabhbhai%20Patel%20mobilised%20the%20peasants%20and%20sustained%20the%20movement." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kheda</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/mains-practice-question/question-557#:~:text=The%20Champaran%20satyagraha%20of%201917,peasantry%20for%20bread%20and%20land.&amp;text=However%2C%20Gandhiji%20led%20the%20struggle,struggles%20to%20the%20national%20movement." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Champaran</strong></a> and<strong> Ahmedabad,</strong> against the atrocities that were being inflicted upon them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beginning of Non-Cooperation:</strong> By the repressive measures of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and the denial of justice, Gandhi observed that &ldquo;the only effective means to vindicate national honour and to prevent a repetition of the wrongs in future is the <strong>establishment of Swaraj&rdquo;.</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Consequently, the non-co-operation campaign was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on 1<sup>st</sup> August, 1919.</li>
<li>The Movement was <strong>initiated in support of the Khilafat Movement.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>During the Movement:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Spread of Non-violence Message:</strong> Millions of the countrymen stopped their work on that day as a mark of their support to Gandhi and as antipathy towards the Government.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Gandhi along with Ali-brothers made extensive tours to <strong>preach the message of national unity and non-cooperation</strong> with the government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Boycott of British Titles and Goods:</strong> The programme of non-cooperation consisted of a <strong>surrender of British titles</strong> and honours,<strong> boycott of British Courts,</strong> Legislatures and educational institutions as well as the <strong>boycott of foreign-made goods.</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The<strong> imports of foreign cloth fell</strong> drastically between 1920 and 1922.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Promotion of Swadeshi:</strong> The boycott led to the promotion of<a href="../swadeshi-and-boycott-movement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Swadeshi</strong></a> goods especially hand-spun and<strong> hand-woven <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/khadi-gramodyog-vikas-yojana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khadi</a> cloth,</strong> the removal of untouchability, the promotion of Hindu-Muslim unity and abstention of alcoholic beverage.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Charkha</strong> became a household article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>People&rsquo;s Response to the Movement:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Students:</strong> Students in thousands left schools and colleges established by the Government and<strong> joined the movement in large numbers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Middle Class People:</strong> They <strong>initially led the movement</strong> but later showed a lot of reservations about Gandhi&rsquo;s programme.</li>
<li><strong>Businessmen:</strong> The economic boycott <strong>received support</strong> from the Indian business group because they had benefited from the nationalists&rsquo; emphasis on the use of swadeshi.</li>
<li><strong>Peasants:</strong> There was a <strong>massive participation by the peasants.</strong> However, it further led to the confrontation between the &lsquo;lower and upper castes&rsquo;.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The movement gave an opportunity to the toiling masses to express their real feelings against the British as well as their Indian masters and oppressors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Women:</strong> Women participated in large numbers, <strong>gave up purdah</strong> and offered their ornaments for the Tilak Fund.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>They took active part in picketing before the shops selling foreign cloth and liquor.</li>
<li>The Tilak Swaraj Fund was announced by Mahatma Gandhi after one year of the beginning of the Non-Cooperation movement.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>The Fund was a homage to Bal Gangadhar Tilak on his first death anniversary, aimed at collecting Rs 1 crore to aid India&rsquo;s freedom struggle and resistance to the British rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Government&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The police resorted to firing which took the lives of a number of people.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Congress and Khilafat Volunteer Organizations were declared unlawful and illegal.</li>
<li>Public meetings were banned and most of the leaders barring Gandhi were arrested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Important Personalities Involved:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Eminent persons like C Rajgopalachari, <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/statue-of-unity-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vallabhbhai Patel</strong></a>, Gopabandhu Das, Ajmal Khan, <a href="../subhash-chandra-bose-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Subhash Chandra Bose</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/legacy-of-jawahar-lal-nehru" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong></a> joined the movement.</li>
<li><strong>Motilal Nehru</strong> and <strong>Chitranjan Das</strong> also joined the movement by giving up their legal profession.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal of Non-Cooperation Movement:</strong> In February 1922, at <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/centenary-of-the-chauri-chaura-incident#:~:text=Chauri%20Chaura%20is%20a%20town,Movement%20(1920%2D22)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Chauri Chaura</strong></a>, Uttar Pradesh, twenty two policemen were brutally killed by the violent mob after the conflict between the mob and the policemen of the Thana.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The news shocked Gandhi too much. Not happy with the increasingly violent trend of the movement, he <strong>immediately announced the withdrawal of the movement.</strong></li>
<li>Most of the nationalist leaders including C.R. Das, Motilal Nehru, Subhash Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, however, <strong>expressed their disagreement at Gandhi&rsquo;s decision to withdraw the movement.</strong></li>
<li>In March 1922, <strong>Gandhi was arrested</strong> and sentenced to six years in jail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes of Failure of the Movement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>No Negotiations by Government:</strong> The movement began showing signs of fatigue as it was not possible to sustain any movement at a high pitch for very long.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Government seemed to be in no mood for negotiations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Relevance of Khilafat Issue:</strong> The central theme of the agitation, the Khilafat question, dissipated soon.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In November 1922, the people of Turkey rose under <strong>Mustafa Kamal Pasha</strong> and <strong>deprived the Sultan of political power.</strong> Turkey was made a secular state.</li>
<li>A European style of legal system was established in Turkey and extensive rights were granted to women.</li>
<li>Education was nationalised and modern agriculture and industries developed.</li>
<li>In 1924, the Khilafat was abolished.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Active Response:</strong> In places like Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, which were centres of elite politicians, the response to Gandhi&rsquo;s call was very limited.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The response to the call for resignation from the government service, surrendering of titles, etc., was not taken seriously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>No Abstinence from Violence:</strong> People had not learnt or fully understood the method of non-violence.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Chauri-Chaura incident marred the spirit of the movement leading to the withdrawal of Non-Cooperation movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Non-Cooperation Movement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Maximum Extent of the Movement:</strong> With the Non-Cooperation Movement, nationalist sentiments reached every nook and corner of the country and politicised every strata of population: the artisans, peasants, students, urban poor, women, traders etc.</li>
<li><strong>Establishment of Swaraj and Swadeshi Institutions:</strong> National institutions like Gujarat Vidyapith, Kashi Vidyapith, Bihar Vidyapitha, the Bengal National University, Jamia Milia Islamia and the National Muslim University were established.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>It gave birth to the strongest idea of having Swaraj, the love for the use of Khadi and becoming a Swadeshi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Instilling Unity among Indians:</strong> The country had been united by specific anti feelings, grievances against the British projecting Gandhi as the only unchallenged leader of the century.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The Khilafat issue was not directly linked to Indian politics but it provided the immediate declaration to the movement and added advantage of cementing Hindu-Muslim unity against the British.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impacts on the Economic Front:</strong> Foreign goods were boycotted and the import of foreign cloth halved between 1921 and 1922.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In many places merchants and traders refused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign trade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="border-bg">
<p><strong>Some Important Events</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>Treaty of Sevres with Turkey</strong> was signed in May 1920 which completely dismembered Turkey.</li>
<li>In June 1920, an <strong>all-party conference at Allahabad</strong> approved a programme of boycott of schools, colleges and law courts, and asked Mahatma Gandhi to lead it.</li>
<li>On August 31, 1920, the<strong> Khilafat Committee started a campaign of non-cooperation</strong> and the movement was formally launched.</li>
<li>In September 1920, at a special session in Calcutta, the <strong>Congress approved a non-cooperation programme</strong> till the Punjab and Khilafat wrongs were removed and swaraj was established.</li>
<li>In December 1920, at the <strong>Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress;</strong> the programme of <strong>non-cooperation was endorsed.</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Some important organisational changes were made: a <strong>Congress Working Committee (CWC) of 15 members was set up</strong> to lead the Congress from now onwards.</li>
