<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong>Key Features:</strong> The caves during the Mauryan period were marked by a<strong> highly polished</strong> finish of the interior walls and <strong><strong>decorative gateways.</strong></strong>

<h3>Significance</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Development of Art and Architecture:</strong> Mauryas made a remarkable contribution to art and architecture, and introduced stone masonry on a wide scale.</li>
<li><strong>Polished Stone Pillar:</strong> High technical skill was achieved by Maurya artisans in polishing the stone pillars, which are as shining as the Northern Black Polished Ware.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The stone statue of Yakshini in the form of a beautiful woman found in Didarganj (Patna) is noted for its Maurya polish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pillars and Sculptor Development:</strong> Each pillar is made of a single piece of buff-colored sandstone. Only their capitals, which are beautiful pieces of sculpture in the form of lions or bulls, are joined to the pillars on the top. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The erection of the polished pillars throughout India shows the spread of the technical knowledge involved in the art of polishing them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cave Architecture:</strong> The Maurya artisans also started the practice of carving out caves from rocks for monks to live in. Later, this form of cave architecture spread to western and southern India.</li>
<li><strong>Development of Terracotta Art:</strong> In the central phase of the Northern Black Polished Ware around 300 BC, the central Gangetic plains became the center of terracotta art. In Maurya rimes, terracottas were produced on a large scale. They generally represented animals (elephants) and women (mother goddesses).</li>
